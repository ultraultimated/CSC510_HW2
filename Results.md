# Methods:
* Languages: Scala, Ruby, Go
* Used Google Forms for getting feedbacks
* Manually recorded time for debugging.
* Prevent user from accessing Rosetta Code
* The evaluation method is a 2 part process.
	Post Evaluation form - This form evaluates the familiarity of user with different languages.
*	Manual Observation during debugging
		- Was the user able to find the compilation and logical bug?
		- Time taken to find the bug?
		- Number of times the code was run?
* The final evaluation will be done by congregating the results of manual observation and post evaluation form.

# Material:
* Zoom
* Google forms
* Repl.it

# Observations:
We did two types of observations: Manual and Post Evaluation with Google Form.
The Manual Observation is recorded by a member from our group while the Post Evaluation form was filled by the users.
## Manual Evaluation:

## Post Evaluation (Google Form)
### Proficieny of test subjects in different languages

### Language likely to be used by the user in future projects

# Conclusions:
* Users are more familiar with Ruby as a result it was found that users took less time to solve bugs and also took less tries to solve it. Go is the least familiar language among three but they took comparatively less number of tries to solve the bugs as that of Scala.
* Based on observation, users found it easy to solve bugs in Ruby followed by Go and Scala.
* In terms of  readability, it is easy to understand Go followed by Ruby and Scala.
* Majority of users prefer to choose Go for working on project rather than using Ruby and Scala.

# Threats to Validity:
* The level of difficulty of the bug was not uniform across different languages.
* We must dry run our entire process to be sure that the process works
